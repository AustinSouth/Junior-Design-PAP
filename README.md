# Alex South Junior-Design-PAP
 Junior Design pick and place Arduino robotics code 

The team designed a robot to identify the location of four randomly placed 
steel balls near the PAP and deposit them sequentially into four locations 
nearby. 

The Mancode.ino file is the Arduino code to manually controll the bot with 
the remote designed by the team.

The PAP_Code.ino file is the Autonomous code that identifies payload locations
using break beam sensing and a sorting algorithm 
and transports them to the drop locations.
